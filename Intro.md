Course Syllabus for "BUS305: Small Business Management"
-------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to entrepreneurship and business
planning. By way of introduction, the word *entrepreneur* originates
from the French word *entreprendre*, meaning to undertake. Today, we
define an entrepreneur as an owner or manager of a business enterprise
who attempts to make profits by starting and growing his or her
business. In earnest, entrepreneurs are a diverse group of risk-takers
who share the same goal of cultivating ideas and developing them into
viable business opportunities. Take a quick look at the statistics below
to get a sense for some of the (potentially surprising) qualities that
have been attributed to entrepreneurs.
-   According to a recent report by the US Census, every day
    approximately 2,356 Americans are becoming entrepreneurs by starting
    new businesses.
-   According to 2006 report from Northeastern University’s School of
    Technological Entrepreneurship, 62% of entrepreneurs in the US claim
    *innate drive* as the number one motivator in starting their
    business.
-   According to a January 2008 report by the Global Entrepreneurship
    Monitor, women run 33% of small businesses.
-   Lastly, according to an October 2006 report by Northeastern
    University’s School of Technological Entrepreneurship, 42% of
    entrepreneurs say they launched their first ventures during
    childhood (i.e., via a lemonade stand, paper route, etc.).

As you can see, the entrepreneurial community is diverse, yet its
members share a number of striking similarities. This course is geared
towards both the eclectic mix of individuals planning to develop and
launch their own businesses as well as those with established small
business ventures that they would like to expand. We will begin by
reviewing the history of small business and identifying a successful
entrepreneur’s characteristics. The course will then coach you in some
basic business skills, teaching you how to write a business plan, launch
a new venture, identify market opportunities, create a marketing plan,
and finance a business. Finally, the course will also review aspects of
building a successful team.

optional assessments in this course to help prepare you for your exam.
