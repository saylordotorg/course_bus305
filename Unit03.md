**Unit 3: The Business Plan** <span id="3"></span> 
*A strong business plan is one of the foundations of a successful
business. It is the tool by which a great idea becomes an
opportunity. It is the creative process that allows the entrepreneur to
document the project’s merits and to articulate a narrative, addressing
the venture’s risks and rewards, to his or her potential investors,
partners, and other stakeholders.   
  
 This unit will present the outline of a business plan, explain the
importance of each section, and provide you with guidance as to how you
can craft this information for your own ventures. We will also cover the
“do’s” and “don’ts” of preparing a business plan. Lastly, this unit will
emphasize how the business plan is not the business itself; it is only a
step from idea to venture, and it is imperative that you understand how
to articulate the business plan succinctly, cleanly, and carefully.  *
