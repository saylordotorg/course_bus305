**Unit 5: Financing the New Venture** <span id="5"></span> 
*Every entrepreneur needs money. It is imperative that you understand
the costs of launching and maintaining a business, from start-up
expenses to operating capital. The financial information and projections
contained in a business plan are vital because they demonstrate the
potential for profit and serve as the guideline for managing the
business’ financial aspects. This unit will teach you how to determine
the costs for launching a new venture and where to get those funds.
Additionally, you will learn to document the current financial status of
the business and project future estimates. You will also examine options
for securing financing or investors and partners to help capitalize the
business.*

    great deal of reporting and compliance requirements. What does this
    means to someone seeking a grant? There will be a great deal of
    paper work associated with obtaining the grant. This also means
    there will be follow-up paper work, providing insight on the use of
    the grant money. These requirements are in place because government
    grants are funded by taxpayer dollars. There are a number of
    additional hyperlinks that will take you to a multitude of
    additional resources. Also, check out [“Does the SBA offer
    Grants?”](http://www.sba.gov/content/does-sba-offer-grants) The
    federal government provides resources for individual states, so they
    may provide more specialized assistance to individuals within their
    respective states. Each state has its own small business division,
    and the title of the division will vary by state.
