**Unit 2: Building the Right Team** <span id="2"></span> 
*Building an effective management team is one of the primary steps in
launching a venture. Entrepreneurs must explore their personal strengths
and weaknesses and then determine the resources needed to fill the
gaps. Successful businesses require not only stellar executives and
advisors but also employees who are a good fit for the company. Thus,
anyone tasked with managing a group of people needs to know how to be an
effective leader. Relative to successful leadership, managing is
easy. *  
  
 *A manager must be able to delegate responsibility and make decisions
for the team, but a leader must be able to influence team behavior. For
this reason, motivation is one of the most powerful tools that a leader
can use. A motivated team will be able to go above and beyond the call
of duty. Using motivation is far from manipulation *– *just look at one
of the greatest leaders of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. *  
  
 *This unit will help you distinguish between management and leadership
and will also explore human resource factors, such as recruitment and
staff selection. The unit will also discuss employee assessments,
emotional intelligence, and Tuckman’s Stages of Group Development.*
